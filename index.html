			In 2018, Kenny Fontaine, a marine biologist with a passion for environmental sustainability, founded AquaClarity with a bold mission: to eliminate and prevent ocean pollution. After witnessing firsthand the devastating effects of plastic waste on marine ecosystems during a research expedition, Kenny decided to create a solution. AquaClarity’s first innovation was a biodegradable filtration system that removed microplastics from ocean water, a breakthrough that caught the attention of environmental organizations and governments. 

Starting with a small team in a coastal lab, the company focused on developing scalable technologies to clean polluted waters. By 2020, AquaClarity had expanded its product line to include floating waste-collection devices and AI-powered systems for detecting and tracking ocean pollution in real time. The company also launched community-driven initiatives to reduce plastic waste at the source. 

With backing from green investors and partnerships with major environmental groups, AquaClarity rapidly grew in influence and reach. By 2023, it had expanded internationally, deploying its technologies in over 30 countries, from Southeast Asia to the Mediterranean. 

Today, AquaClarity stands as a leading force in ocean conservation, employing hundreds of passionate individuals worldwide, and continues to innovate toward a cleaner, more sustainable future for the world’s oceans.
