			AquaClarity is committed to transparency, sustainability, and responsible growth in all aspects of its operations, including financing. The company follows a hybrid financing model, combining venture capital, grants, and strategic partnerships to fund its innovative ocean conservation projects. AquaClarity works closely with impact investors who share its environmental mission, ensuring that all funding supports long-term, scalable solutions to ocean pollution. In addition to private investment, AquaClarity actively pursues government and NGO grants to expand its reach and impact, particularly in developing regions. The company also reinvests a portion of its profits into research and development to continuously improve its technologies. AquaClarity maintains strict financial oversight to ensure that all funds are allocated efficiently, with regular audits and transparent reporting on how financial resources are used to meet environmental and business goals.

			AquaClarity strives to ensure a smooth and transparent delivery and return process for all customers. We offer worldwide shipping for most of our products, with varying delivery times based on location and product size. Orders are typically processed within 2-3 business days, and customers receive tracking information once their products have shipped. For larger or specialized products, such as marine equipment, delivery times may vary, and AquaClarity works closely with logistics partners to ensure safe and timely arrivals.
